# Arpita-Repository
## Motivation
* This repository is going to help me in collaborating with my classmates at [UW in MLGeo-2023](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-Autumn22)
* It is going to make documentation more organized
## My Repository

## Favorite topics
* **Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering** <br>
This deals with the interaction of soil and rock with seismic forces. It involves studying how soil and geological conditions can amplify or dampen earthquake motions, how foundations can be designed to resist seismic loads, and how to mitigate earthquake-induced hazards related to soil liquefaction, landslides, and ground shaking.
* **Slope Stability** <br>
It involves the study of the stability of slopes and landforms. This field of study is concerned with understanding and predicting the stability of natural and man-made slopes, such as hillsides, cliffs, embankments, and other terrain features.
## Choice of Licensing
**MIT License -** It is a permissive open-source license which allows easy usage, modification and distribution of code. This in turn promotes collaboration. It is easy to understand and implement.
